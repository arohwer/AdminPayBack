            of Computer Science, principally located at Salt Lake City, Utah, ("Receiving Party") for the purpose of preventing
            the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information as defined below.</div>

          <div class="textLayer--absolute">The parties agree to enter into a confidential relationship with respect to the disclosure of certain proprietary
            and confidential information ("Confidential Information").</div>

          <div class="nc-yellow">1. Definition of Confidential Information.</div>
          <div class="textLayer--absolute">For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall include all information or material that has or
            could have commercial value or other utility in the business in which Disclosing Party is engaged. If Confidential
            Information is in written form, the Disclosing Party shall label or stamp the materials with the word "Confidential"
            or some similar warning. If Confidential Information is transmitted orally, the Disclosing Party shall promptly
            provide a writing indicating that such oral communication constituted Confidential Information.

            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) publicly known at the time of disclosure or subsequently becomes publicly known through
            no fault of the Receiving Party;
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) discovered or created by the Receiving Party before disclosure by Disclosing Party;
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) learned by the Receiving Party through legitimate means other than from the Disclosing

          <div class="nc-yellow">3. Obligations of Receiving Party.</div>
          <div class="textLayer--absolute">Receiving Party shall hold and maintain the Confidential Information in strictest confidence for the sole and exclusive
            benefit of the Disclosing Party. Receiving Party shall carefully restrict access to Confidential Information
            to employees, contractors and third parties as is reasonably required and shall require those persons to sign
            nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those in this Agreement. Receiving Party shall not, without
            prior written approval of Disclosing Party, use for Receiving Party's own benefit, publish, copy, or otherwise
            disclose to others, or permit the use by others for their benefit or to the detriment of Disclosing Party, any
            Confidential Information. Receiving Party shall return to Disclosing Party any and all records, notes, and other
            written, printed, or tangible materials in its possession pertaining to Confidential Information immediately
            if Disclosing Party requests it in writing.</div>

            duty to hold Confidential Information in confidence shall remain in effect until the Confidential Information
            no longer qualifies as a trade secret or until Disclosing Party sends Receiving Party written notice releasing
            Receiving Party from this Agreement, whichever occurs first.</div>

          <div class="nc-yellow">5. Relationships.</div>
          <div class="textLayer--absolute">Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute either party a partner, joint venturer or employee
            of the other party for any purpose.</div>
          <br>
          <div class="nc-yellow">6. Severability.</div>
          <div class="textLayer--absolute">If a court finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall
            be interpreted so as best to effect the intent of the parties.</div>
          <br>

          <div class="nc-yellow">7. Integration.</div>
          <div class="textLayer--absolute">This Agreement expresses the complete understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter and supersedes
